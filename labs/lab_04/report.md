It's important to choose a license as otherwise then no one has permission to use or change your code. Without a license the code is unable to be used as an open source piece, "all rights reserved" and all that. Each person who wants to work with or use the code will need explicit premission to do so. Therefore for code to be open source it needs a license.

For the same reasons above you shouldn't use code without an explicit license. If it doesn't have a license and you use it the codeâ€™s copyright holder has legal basis to sue. Now they might not and maybe they meant for it to be licensed and just forgot but that isn't set in stone and if you act like it was licensed it could have massive consequences.

I feel it is a hard claim to disagree with simply because it's an event that happened to go one way. Therefore there must have been a number of reasons that caused those issues possibly including a failure to follow the open systems model. However it's not that it's a bad assumption to make as the early internet was a massive "wild west" with the greatest resource being developers. Without support of the greater community and the fact that they weren't established enough to make themselves necessary they would certainly be in some trouble.

Microsoft's .NET Core seems like an odd choice to be open source. After all, Microsoft is known as one of the proprietary giants of the industry and this took some of their work and allowed it to be run on their rival OS systems in Linux and Mac? It seems like something Microsoft just wouldn't do. However Microsoft, at the time of sending .NET to open source, was changing, Satya Nadella had just came in and Microsoft was trying desperately to regain relevance in a world that thought of it as somewhat archaic (https://fortune.com/2021/12/21/microsoft-cultural-transformation-book-excerpt-satya-nadella/). This change also required regaining credibility and mindshare amoung developers something that pushing open source could help with. Developers were mostly positive on the change (https://www.toptal.com/dot-net/dotnet-core-going-wild-and-open-source-what-took-you-so-long). Looking back almost 8 years out from these changes it seems to have mostly worked (https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2019-12-21/satya-nadella-reinvigorated-microsoft). While Microsoft does still get some backlash for their decisions the anger seems to be because Microsoft actually has some expectations placed on it rather then it simply being the "big bad" (https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740701/microsoft-dotnet-hot-reload-removal-decision-open-source).
