Step 2:
Find the Nightly and Experimental sections and look at some of the submissions. How can you see what tests were run for a particular submission?
If you click on the submission you can look into the build's information. You can then scroll to the bottom and if tests were taken you can click on a summary to see specifics.

Find a submission with errors. Can you see what the error condition was? How does this help you debug the failure?
It does explain what the error is which helps as it allows you to target your fixes in a certain direction (in this case knowing it's a permission error can help)

Find a system that is close to your specific configuration in the Nightly, Nightly Expected or one of the Masters sections. How clean is the dashboard? Are there any errors that you need to be concerned with?

It had a clean dashboard and had no errors or warnings. Therefore there is likely nothing to be worried about (though how long this took to get set up might say otherwise).

The only difference is that date (2020 instead of 2022)
