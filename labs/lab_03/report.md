#### Part 1

Code and results:

For both of these I wasn't sure if I needed to be more complex with it.

#### Part 2

NOTE: Not every single tablemate managed to get Gource working due to seg faults. I managed to get it working a posted my results in AutoLogin. I also included the results from 2 other tablemates who had gotten it to work as well.

What I noticed about the differences between the gitstats' results vs the results we found on our own was as follows.

The number of lines was always different with the smallest difference being 3 and the largest being in the thousands.\
The number of authors was often different with the likely reason for that being duplicate authors (as noted by one of my tablemates in their AutoPR writeup).\
The first and last commit seem to line up which makes sense as those should be fairly set in stone. \
Overall I think the close reading version is slightly better due to duplicate authors showing up (which could add some confusion) but both seem to be viable solutions, with one being a lot faster.\
