After some initial struggles running docker we were on our way

Example 0:

It took me a bit to get setup mostly because it wasn't initially clear that I had actually created a docker file. Once I relooked over the tutorial though I was on my way.

Example 1:

Fairly self explanitory without much difficulty I had some issues trying to enter and exit the vim and the constant swapping of different folders and layers made it a bit annoying to follow.

Example 2:

The interlocking nature of the different created pieces made deletion harder than expected but stopping and running the sections worked as expected.

Example 3:

I ran into some issues when trying to create the Dockerfile at first as I didn't have the hello.py code in the right folder. Once I figured that out everything fell into place. The fact that ADD . /opt/webapp/ doesn't need to state the actual folder is interesting as normally everything so far has been extra specific.
