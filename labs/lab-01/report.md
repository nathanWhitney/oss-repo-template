# Lab 01 Report - Introduction to Open Source Software

I tried various ways to shrink the images none of them worked

Step 1 - Discord:

Step 2:
For the first article I was a bit suprised that open source software had more specifications then I had originally thought of. I thought it was only really free software that was able to be found online where it is actually a lot more than that. The number of limitations in place to make sure that it's actually available for everyone was impressive.

A quick notes before my other suggestions the author really donesn't do a good job of making asking questions seem like a good idea, maybe that was his intent though as the community presented seemed to like figuring out stuff for themselves.
Other suggestions:
1) Link to other solutions if you know of them as well as relevant related information. If you have helpful related information adding it to you post it might help.
2) Don't assume knowledge (or lack of knowledge). Some people asking questions might have sporatic information don't assume they know or don't know something based on their question.
3) Don't always trust links. There are times where the links you post or image formats no longer exist a few years later try to make sure it's from a source that will stick around

The fact that it took place at RPI was both rather cool and a bit worrisome. It's cool in that the story was instantly relatable and it's worrisome in that it is relatable. This isn't something that should happen to anyone and the fact that it was done (and still goes on looking at what happens with twitch and youtube) is crazy. It shows the risks of working with open source software. If you are messing around and make something good you are in part responsible for what is done with it, if not in personal feelings then in name. People will connect that work back to you even if it wasn't the intended purpose and even if it also did a lot of good. Overall though what will stick with me is how completely unnecessary it all was. It was barely any money. They just wanted to make an example of him that at the end of the day only reflects poorly on them. On the coding side it's good to see we have a legacy of tinkering though.

In an effort to save space I only used a photo of the last one and posted the answers here for the others

Step 6:
Battle for Wesnoth
http://aosabook.org/en/wesnoth.html

This was a project that I found interesting.
As someone who plays a lot of games and tutors in block based code such as Scratch I do think the basic idea of trying to help introduce people to coding at the loss of some coding structure. The fact that it's made in a language (C++) that is amoung the ones I'm most experienced in means I'd be able to look into it with a good amount of depth. The creation of Wesnoth Markup Language (WML) is also very interesting and harkens back to how a decent chunk of game designers got their start through mods. Reading through the "units" section it's clear that WML doesn't add complete freedom but does add enough flexibility that it isn't exactly like custom game features that a lot of games have leaning closer to formats suchs as Overwatch's Workshop mode (basically it lies somewhere in between conventional languages and preset "block" coding). Overall the goal of creating a game that encourages people to code is one that's worth looking more into.
